# ECSplore 2019 Mentee Guide

Hi there! First of all, welcome to our department! We are so excited you will be joining us this fall. Furthermore, you made a great choice participating the ECSplore program, it will be super beneficial for you! 


## Program Overview
This new program is to welcome incoming ECSIES to McGill and facilitate their integration into our department and university. Each mentor (ECSperts) will be paired with mentees and mentors will be sharing their ECSperiences on various aspects of being an ECSE student such as academics, involvement, jobs, social life and wellness as well as answering any questions mentees might have.

This is a 4-week program starting the week of August 19 and coming to an end with a **FUN** mentor-mentee social in September 19! 

## Expectations from Mentees
**PLEASE READ**
**_THIS PART WILLBE EDITED!)_**
* As a mentee, your role is to provide support and advice to your mentee as well as answering any /questions they might have through these 4 weeks! Don't be afraid to give your honest opinion on academics (which classes to take, profs you don't like etc.), finding internships, involvement, social life, wellness and many more topics you might want to discuss! We prepared a guideline to guide you on which topics you might want to discuss with your mentor but you are **more than welcome** to discuss your own topics, ask other questions and follow your own branch!
///////
* Your mentor will be contacting you in mid-August to introduce themselves and to arrange the first meeting! The form of communication can be of any form and at any time during the specified weeks, whichever is the most accessible and convenient for both the mentor and the mentee. However, I ~~require~~ **kindly ask and strongly encourage** that you meet with your mentor at least once every week for 20-30 minutes throughout these 4 weeks for this program to bve as beneficial as possible! I also strongly encourage that your communication is of a verbal form. Phone calls, skype, facetime, meeting at a cafe are some of my recommendations! 

* We will be organising a mentor-mentee social at the end of the program and you are expected to come to it! You will get to meet with your mentor in person if all your conversations were on skype or on phone! This is also a chance to meet other mentors and incoming ECSE students aka your classmates and your future ECSE 211 lab partners!

* I recommend keeping in touch with your mentor after the program ends as well! You are welcome to ask any questions you might have through the year to them! I hope you build a lasting friendship with your mentor!

## Communication: 
As mentioned above, menteess can communicate with their mentors via any way of communication at any time during the specified weeks. The time and the means of communication depends on the accessibility and convenience for both the mentee and the mentor. It is not at all a requirement to be in Montreal however we do require that your communication be of verbal form such as phone calls, facetime, skype, facebook calls or in person if you are in the same city! The mentor will reach out to the mentee to arrange the first meeting.

## Suggested Timeline and Guide: 
Below is a suggested timeline of topics to discuss between the mentor and mentee throughout the 4 weeks. Remember this is just a suggestion, please don’t feel pressured to follow this guide! Each mentor and mentee is different so obviously topics to be discussed will vary. This guide is just nice to have in case you have difficulty finding topics and to avoid awkward silences during your conversations with your mentor. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make this mentorship as personalised as possible, ask your own questions and remember you absolutely don’t have to follow this guide! :)
