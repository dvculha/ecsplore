# ECSplore First Year Mentoring Program 2019

Bonjour hi! First of all, thank you so so so much for signing up to be a mentor! You’re helping to make ECSESS a better community.


## Program Overview
This new program is to welcome incoming ECSIES to McGill and facilitate their integration into our department and university. Each mentor (ECSperts) will be paired with mentees and mentors will be sharing their ECSperiences on various aspects of being an ECSE student such as academics, involvement, jobs, social life and wellness!

This is a 4-week program starting the week of August 19 and coming to an end with a **FUN** mentor-mentee social in September 19!

### Expectations from Mentors
**PLEASE READ**

* As a mentor, your role is to provide support and advice to your mentee as well as answering any questions they might have through these 4 weeks! Don't be afraid to give your honest opinion on academics (which classes to take, profs you don't like etc.), finding internships, involvement, social life, wellness and many more topics you might want to discuss! We prepared a guideline to guide you on which topics you might want to discuss with your mentee but you are **more than welcome** to discuss your own topics and follow your own branch!

* Once you receive an email with the name of your mentee, please contact them as soon as possible via email and introduce yourself. Please CC me (ecsess.vpinternal@mcgilleus.ca) on that email so I can ensure the mentorship has started between you and your mentee! :blush:

* You should take the initiative to decide on the mean of communication. Please contact your mentee to arrange the first meeting and the other meetings! The form of communication can be of any form and at any time during the specified weeks, whichever is the most accessible and convenient for both the mentor and the mentee. However, I ~~require~~ **kindly ask and strongly encourage** that you meet with your mentee at least once every week for 20-30 minutes throughout these 4 weeks and that your communication is of a verbal form. Phone calls, skype, facetime, meeting at a cafe are some of my recommendations!

* We will be organising a mentor-mentee social at the end of the program and you are expected to come to it! You will get to meet with your mentees in person if all your conversations were on skype or on phone! This is also a chance to meet other mentors and incoming ECSE students aka your classmates and your future/past ECSE 211 lab partners! See you there!

* I recommend keeping in touch with your mentees after the program ends as well! Maybe invite them to Blues Pub, come with them to the upcoming ECSESS events (*cough cough* hinting at pancake breakfasts and socials)! I hope you build a lasting friendship with your mentees!

### Communication:
As mentioned above, mentors can communicate with their mentees via any way of communication at any time during the specified weeks. The time and the means of communication depends on the accessibility and convenience for both the mentee and the mentor. It is not at all a requirement to be in Montreal however we do require that your communication be of verbal form such as phone calls, facetime, skype, facebook calls or in person if you are in the same city! The mentor will reach out to the mentee to arrange the first meeting.

### Suggested Timeline and Guide:
Below is a suggested timeline of topics to discuss between the mentor and mentee, throughout the 4 weeks. Remeber this is just a suggestion and it’s nice to have in case you have difficulty finding topics to discuss or have difficulty finding answers for some questions! Each mentor and mentee is different and thus might want to get advice on different topics! Please please please feel free to branch away from the topics outlined and include your own topics, answer questions your own way, talk about your own experiences and give your personal tips and tricks! Don’t feel pressured to cover everything on this guide too, make this a very personalised experience!
