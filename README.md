Although online applications work out for some, the best thing you can do is to make a connection *in person*. Ask your mentor for help in this department! Real, human connections can save you time and also save you from writing a cover letter. There are tons of university/campus recruiters that come to McGill each year; getting your CV directly to them will yield stronger results than aimlessly applying online.
